Hi, I’m Geraldine Alcindor
I’m a Data Analytics graduate student with a background in digital marketing, retail, and merchandising. Over the past 8 years, I’ve worked in roles where I combined business insights with customer behavior analysis to drive sales and improve performance. Now, I’m building on that foundation by applying data analytics, SQL, Python, and visualization tools to uncover actionable insights and solve business problems.

#  What I Do:

Analyze datasets with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) and SQL

Build dashboards in Tableau/Power BI to communicate insights

Apply A/B testing, forecasting, and segmentation to guide decisions

Blend marketing knowledge with data science for customer-focused strategies

# Featured Projects:

Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test – Identified most effective promotion using statistical analysis

Luxury Cosmetics SQL Analysis – Revealed revenue-driving demographics for pop-up stores

Consumer Spending Trends – Time-series dashboards tracking 15 years of spending

Perfume E-Commerce Market Analysis – Highlighted top countries driving global sales

BMW Sales Data Analysis – Found key drivers of model performance across regions

# Career Goal:
To grow into a Data Analyst / Marketing Analytics role where I can bridge the gap between business strategy and data science, using insights to optimize performance and customer engagement.
